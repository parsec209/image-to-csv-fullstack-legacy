      This module contains the methods used for obtaining CSV cell section values from an uploaded file's text. Some of the 
      methods are straightforward. For instance, the "pattern" method searches for text that matches a regular expression 
      provided by the user. The "customValue" is just a literal value provided by the user, no text parsing necessary. The "today" method uses today's date
      (more specifically the date from the user's browser) as the value.

      The positional "topPhrase" and "leftPhrase" methods are a bit more complicated. First, the term "phrase" has a specific meaning in the context of this application. It is a 
      single line of text consisting of characters no more than one space apart from each other. A phrase ends when a character is proceeded by two or more spaces, a line break, or a
      page break. Furthermore, what we're using in these methods are "anchor phrases," meaning a phrase within a recurring document that has the following constants: 1) it is always 
      in the same exact position of the document relative to the sought-after variable value, and 2) it is always the same phrase.

      With the leftPhrase option selected, the sorted text line array (see tutorial on the TextLineGenerator) is parsed for a left anchor phrase specified by the user; 
      once found, the array is parsed for a phrase located <i>n</i> indeces higher than the anchor phrase index, <i>n</i> representing the phrase count specified by the 
      user. This phrase, if found, will be used as the cell section value.

      With the topPhrase option selected, the sorted text line array is parsed for a top anchor phrase specified by the user; 
      once found, the array is parsed for a phrase located <i>n</i> lines directly beneath the anchor phrase, <i>n</i> representing the phrase count specified by the 
      user. <i>Directly beneath</i>, in this context, means the anchor phrase overlaps horizontally with the target phrase (they share an x-coordinate). Phrase location
      is determined from the char coordinates obtained during the OCR process.
