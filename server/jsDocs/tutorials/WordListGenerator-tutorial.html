      This <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/AnnotateImageResponse#TextAnnotation">link</a> shows the object hierarchy that the GCP Vision API
      generates from a page's extracted text (Page-Block-Paragraph-Word-Symbol). This works well with documents that mainly contain natural language and predictable
      layout of text (i.e. paragraphs, etc.) However, with a document such as an invoice, the text layout on the page is not only less predictable, but special characters, 
      letters, and numbers are often combined together in ways not normally seen in natural language. Therefore, this application takes an extra step to create an  
      array of all the document's words generated from the GCP output and sorts these words based on their vertices, in a left to right, line by line, order. This is the same 
      order a human would read lines of text on a page. The final result will be a 2D array of the entire doc (outer array) with each doc page (inner arrays) containing 
      the GCP word objects. This predictable word order makes it easier to locate text positioned relative to other text (i.e. finding metadata using an "anchor phrase").
